# Unclosed Tag in innerHTML - HTML Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in HTML related to using `innerHTML` to inject content with a missing closing tag.  The browser's behavior is not always consistent when encountering such errors, making them difficult to debug.  The `bug.html` file shows the bug, and the `bugSolution.html` file shows the corrected code.

## Bug Description

The bug involves dynamically adding HTML content using `innerHTML`.  If the injected content contains a missing closing tag, it can affect the rendering of the entire document. In some browsers, it may lead to the rest of the page not rendering correctly.  In this example, a paragraph is missing its closing tag, which can cause visual and functional inconsistencies.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully checking the validity of the HTML string before using `innerHTML`.  Always ensure that all opening tags have their corresponding closing tags.  Using DOM manipulation instead of innerHTML can help prevent this kind of error.
